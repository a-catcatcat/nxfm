# nxfm
A work-in-progress file manager for the Nintendo Switch using `libnx`, `nxfm` is a tentative name. Currently, the most basic rudimentary file viewing is functional, however there are no other features beyond that at the moment. Furthermore, the code itself is a bit of a mess at the moment, so don't expect much for a bit.

### Build and installation instructions
Simply `git clone` and `make` and then put the resulting `nxfm.nro` file in the `/switch` folder in the root of your SDCard.
